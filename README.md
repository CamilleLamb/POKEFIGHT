# POKEFIGHT
Pokemon API using PHP and Bootstrap (with french comments)


# How does it works ?

The program connects to a Pokemon Application Progamming Interface (API), which allows it to get all the the necessary informations about Pokemons.

The user can then pick two first generation Pokemons and throw a fight between them.

- Both Pokemons are introduced

- One attacks the other who then fights back.

# POKEFIGHT
Pokemon API using PHP and Bootstrap (with french comments)

I did it in class at La Passerelle school (Paris, FR). My teacher was Benoît Brice.

# How does it works ?

The program connects to a Pokemon Application Progamming Interface (API), which allows it to get all the the necessary informations about Pokemons.

The user can then pick two first generation Pokemons and throw a fight between them.

- Both Pokemons are introduced

- One attacks the other who then fights back. They both have random attack points and random defense points to absorb the attack.

- One's life points gets affected by the other's attack.

- They both self-heal.

- At the end of the process, if one's life points is equal to zero or negative, the Pokemon dies. :( (Video games really are violent !)
